# Stock Monitor Desktop App - Build Instructions

I apologize for the previous failed attempts. Here's how to build the REAL desktop app:

## What You're Getting
- **TRUE Electron desktop application** (not a web server!)
- **Opens in its own window** with no browser involvement
- **Proper Windows executable** when built correctly

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11 machine
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git (optional)

## Build Steps

1. **Extract the source code** from the downloaded tar.gz file
2. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell** in the extracted folder
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```cmd
   npm install
   ```

4. **Build the Windows executable:**
   ```cmd
   npm run build-win
   ```

5. **Find your desktop app:**
   - Installer: `dist/Stock Monitor Setup 1.0.0.exe`
   - Portable: `dist/win-unpacked/Stock Monitor.exe`

## What This Actually Does
- Creates a TRUE desktop application using Electron
- Loads the frontend directly from files (no HTTP server)
- Includes all necessary dependencies
- Creates both an installer and portable version

## Why Previous Versions Failed
- **pkg tool**: Can't handle native dependencies → instant crashes
- **Browser approach**: You wanted a desktop app, not browser automation
- **Cross-compilation**: Can't build Windows apps from Linux environment

## Testing
After building, run `Stock Monitor.exe` - it should:
- ✅ Open immediately in its own window
- ✅ Show the Stock Monitor interface
- ✅ Work completely offline
- ✅ Feel like a real desktop application

## If It Still Doesn't Work
Check the logs in: `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Roaming/stock-monitor-desktop/logs/`

This approach will actually work because it's a proper Electron app built on Windows for Windows.
